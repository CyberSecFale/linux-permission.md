# Linux Commands for File Permissions

I used Linux commands to manage file permissions in a security context, ensuring sensitive files were protected. I applied commands like `chmod` and `chown` to restrict access to authorized users only, preventing unauthorized access to critical data.

**Commands Used:** `chmod 640 sensitive-file.txt`, `chown user:group sensitive-file.txt`  
**Outcome:** Enhanced security by enforcing least privilege access on the system.
